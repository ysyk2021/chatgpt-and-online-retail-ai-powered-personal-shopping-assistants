AI and chatbots are rapidly changing the online retail industry by providing new ways for companies to interact with customers and personalize the shopping experience. In this chapter, we will introduce AI and chatbots and their role in online retail.

What is AI?
-----------

AI stands for artificial intelligence, which refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI can analyze large amounts of data quickly and accurately, enabling companies to make better decisions and provide personalized experiences to customers.

What are Chatbots?

Chatbots are software programs that use natural language processing (NLP) to interact with users in a conversational way. Chatbots can be integrated into messaging or chat platforms, websites, and mobile apps. They can answer common questions, provide customer service, and assist customers with their purchases.

In conclusion, AI and chatbots are powerful tools for online retail companies looking to improve the shopping experience for customers. By using AI and chatbots effectively, companies can increase customer satisfaction, loyalty, and sales while reducing costs.
