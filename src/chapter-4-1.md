Chatbots are AI-powered conversational agents designed to interact with users through text or voice interfaces. They simulate human-like conversations and offer automated assistance. In the context of online retail and personal shopping assistants, chatbots play a crucial role in enhancing customer engagement, providing personalized recommendations, and offering seamless shopping experiences.

Ethical and Privacy Considerations
