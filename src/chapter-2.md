Customer experience is critical in the online retail industry. Customers expect a seamless and personalized shopping experience that meets their needs and preferences.

Personalization is key to improving the shopping experience in the online retail industry. By analyzing customer behavior and preferences, companies can provide personalized recommendations, offers, and assistance to customers. This leads to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and sales.
